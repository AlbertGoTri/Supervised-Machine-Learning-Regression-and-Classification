# 🤖 Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

Welcome to my repository for the Coursera course [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by **Andrew Ng**, offered through **DeepLearning.AI**.

This course provides a solid foundation in supervised machine learning using Python and key libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. Here you'll find all my coursework, code examples, and notes from the journey.

## 📚 Course Summary

This course covers:

- 🔢 **Linear Regression**: One-variable and multivariable, feature scaling, gradient descent.
- 🎯 **Logistic Regression**: Classification tasks, sigmoid function, decision boundaries.
- 💡 **Loss Functions**: Mean squared error, cross-entropy.
- 📏 **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
- 🛠️ **Model Building Tools**: scikit-learn pipelines, training/test splits.
- 🧠 **Real-world Applications**: Medical diagnostics, spam detection, house price prediction.
